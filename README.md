React project which makes use of Dijkstra's Algorithm to recreate a Google-Maps-like feature. (Dijkstra's isn't anywhere as fast to work on such a scale, however.)
This repo is still a work in progress as I work to implement more algorithms (BFS, DFS, etc) and improve the CSS.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
